# Hacker Beach Map (Phu Quoc)

This is an interactive map app, showing points of interest to participants of
Hacker Beach 12/13 on Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam. You can launch it from:

[http://maps.hackerbeach.org](http://maps.hackerbeach.org)

It works well on both desktop browsers and smartphones, so you can take it with
you when exploring the island.

## Contributions welcome!

You can contribute new places by forking the repo, editing `places.json` and
then doing a pull request. The format is a subset of
[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/), but it's really just a few attributes.

You can also contribute improvements to the app itself if you like (it's really
simple), or use the code for your own purposes.

## Install

You can also install the app in various formats from 5apps or add it to your
home screen to install on iOS:
